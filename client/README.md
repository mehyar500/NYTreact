Functionality

On the backend, the app uses express to serve routes and mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database.

On the frontend, the app uses ReactJS for rendering components, axios for internal/external API calls, and bootstrap as a styling framework.

In order to transpile the JSX code, webpack and babel were utilized. All of the JSX code in the /app folder was transpiled into the bundle.js file located in the /public folder.
